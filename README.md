## Creating a project from my learnings of the Gameplay Ability System

While learning GAS in UE5 from this course https://www.udemy.com/course/unreal-engine-5-gas-top-down-rpg/
I have made this repository to consolidate my learning. All the assets are provided in the course. I hope to extend
and apply this knowledge when making my own games in the future.
